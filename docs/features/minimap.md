# Minimap

The **Map** widget (`show_minimap_widget` in `src/ui/dashboard.rs`) renders the
car's position over a cached top-down map image, using a world-metres → screen-pixel
transform calibrated to the game's coordinate space. It's one of the standard
[[dashboard]] widgets.

## Map image & seasons

FH6's overworld map skin rotates weekly (Spring → Summer → Autumn → Winter,
`current_season()` in `src/minimap.rs`, a wall-clock rotation keyed off a fixed epoch,
not read from packets). The app loads and colour-caches the matching map image for the
detected season in a background thread (`app.rs:map_load_thread`), at a configurable
**Image quality** (20–100%, lower = faster load/less memory); **Reload Map** re-fetches,
**Rebuild Map Cache** clears the on-disk cache (`app_data_dir()/map_cache`, including the
HUD overlay's copy) first. The season is re-checked continuously, so the image swaps
automatically when the in-game season changes.

## Map image source

The four bundled season maps (`assets/maps/{spring,summer,autumn,winter}.jpg`, 8192²,
embedded via `include_bytes!` in `src/minimap.rs`) are the hi-res seasonal FH6 maps
published by Reddit user **Le0_X8**:
<https://www.reddit.com/r/ForzaHorizon/comments/1td6qzb/8096x_hires_seasonal_maps_of_fh6_from_the_early/>

The credit is shown in the app: **Setup** tab → **Repository / Credits** category
(`repo_card` in `src/ui/settings.rs`), as the link "Le0_X8 — seasonal map images" under
"Credits".

**Why it matters:** if the images are replaced, re-cropped, or used to derive other data
(e.g. road extraction), keep that credit (or update it to the new source) — the maps are
someone else's work.

## Shared code (`src/minimap.rs`)

The season logic, the image loading/cache and the map maths live in `src/minimap.rs`,
shared by this widget and the in-game HUD overlay's minimap ([[overlay]]). Nothing in it
takes `&ForzaApp`, so the overlay thread can call it.

- **Cache:** `load_map_color_image(season, quality)` decodes the 8192² JPEG once, writes
  `map_cache/<season>_q<quality>.bin`, and reads that file afterwards. The write is
  **atomic** (unique temp file, then rename). *Why:* the Dashboard loader and the overlay's
  `hud-map` thread can build or read the same file at once, and a reader must never see a
  partial file.
- **Maths:** `MapCalibration` (world ↔ UV in original-image pixels), `MapView` (heading-up
  offsets, UV per mesh vertex, compass direction, arrow angle), `target_yaw` /
  `ease_yaw` / `ease_zoom`, and the stopped rule (`STOPPED_KMH` 5, `STOPPED_SECS` 1.5).
  The Dashboard camera in `app.rs` uses these too.
- **The overlay's copy:** `overlay_map_image(season)` is the **q50 (4096²)** cache file,
  uploaded with `OVERLAY_MAP_TEXTURE_OPTIONS`: linear filtering with **trilinear mipmaps**
  (egui_glow builds the chain on upload) and **MirroredRepeat** wrapping. *Why mipmaps:* the HUD map is
  heavily minified and rotates, which shimmers without them. The Dashboard map has no
  mipmaps (it aliases; out of scope so far) and its texture wraps with MirroredRepeat
  (visible when **Mirror map at edges** lets UVs past the edge).
  The overlay texture now wraps with `MirroredRepeat` too, so **Mirror map at edges** works on both
(the HUD cuts the pill to the image when mirroring is off, see [[overlay]]). The q50 file is shared with a Dashboard set
  to 50 % quality. The overlay keeps no RAM copy: it uploads, then drops the image.

## Calibration

World coordinates map to image pixels via three tunable constants under
**Advanced calibration**:

- `minimap_px_per_m` — pixels per metre.
- `minimap_world_origin_x` / `minimap_world_origin_z` — world X/Z at pixel (0,0).

These default to values derived from in-game reference points; **Reset to
defaults** restores them if the car dot drifts off the map after tuning. The HUD overlay's
minimap uses the same three config values (carried in its snapshot).

**Known duplicate:** the default numbers (0.3722, −12540, 10738) exist twice, as
`MapCalibration::DEFAULT` in `src/minimap.rs` and in `AppConfig::default()` in
`src/config.rs`. Change both together.

## Orientation: north-up vs heading-up

- **F10** (or the **Lock map north-up** checkbox) toggles between:
  - **North-up** — the map is fixed; only the car arrow rotates.
  - **Heading-up** (default) — the map rotates under a fixed, up-pointing car
    arrow, using either the raw yaw or (`Use movement direction as rotation`)
    the velocity vector's heading instead.
- **North up when stopped** — in heading-up mode, once speed drops under 5 km/h
  for 1.5s the map eases back to north-up, then eases back to heading-up as soon
  as the car moves again.
- **Smooth rotation** — lerps the map's rotation each frame instead of snapping;
  the ease-to-north animation always lerps regardless of this setting.

## Zoom

The visible radius (metres from the widget's centre to its nearest edge) is
interpolated toward one of two targets: **Zoom when driving** (default smaller
radius, engages immediately above 5 km/h) or **Zoom when stopped** (default larger
radius, engages 1.5s after dropping under 5 km/h) — both configurable, so the map
auto-zooms in while driving and back out once parked.

## Other display options

- **Mirror map at edges** — instead of clipping at the image boundary, the mesh's
  UVs are allowed outside [0,1] and the texture sampler mirrors/repeats, so panning
  past the map edge shows a reflected continuation rather than a hard cutoff.
- **Show compass** — a compass disc with a two-colour needle in the top-left corner
  pointing to world-north (`MapView::north_dir`, so it is right in north-up and heading-up
  modes alike). It is the HUD Minimap's compass, drawn by the shared
  `hud::minimap::draw_compass`, scaled with the widget (`min(w,h)/200`, clamped 0.8-1.6).
  *Why:* the user prefers the HUD look, and one implementation keeps the two identical.
- **Render FPS limit** — throttles how often the car's cached position/yaw are
  refreshed for the minimap, independent of the app's global FPS limit.

## Look-around (right stick)

Option **Rotate with right stick** (`minimap_look_stick`, off; Mini-Settings -> Dashboard -> Map; the
HUD Minimap has `OverlayConfig::map_look_stick`, see [[overlay]]). While the right stick
(`Gamepad::right_stick`, post-deadzone, see [[gamepad]]) is deflected, the view turns to look where the
stick points **relative to the car**, like the game's camera.

**Intended behaviour (both modes, both maps):** stick angle `θ = minimap::look_offset((x, y)) =
atan2(x, y)` (up = 0, right = +90 deg, down = 180 deg; clockwise, matching the map yaw). With the stick
held, the view yaw becomes `heading + θ`, where `heading` is the heading-up yaw
(`minimap::target_yaw`, i.e. the car's yaw or movement direction). So stick right puts the car's right
at the top, stick down looks behind it, stick up shows "ahead" (in north-up that turns the map
heading-up for as long as it is held). The car stays at the view centre (the rotation pivot); the car
arrow (`arrow_angle` = `raw yaw - view yaw` = `-θ` in raw-yaw heading) and the compass (`north_dir`)
follow from the same `MapView` yaw, so they stay geometrically correct. Released (or option off), the
view eases back to the mode's own orientation (north, or heading).

**Implementation:** the eased offset `look` (`ForzaApp::minimap_look_off`, `MapAnim::look`) is added
to the map's base yaw (`ForzaApp::minimap_base_yaw()`: 0 when north-up, else the smoothed heading-up
yaw; the HUD's eased `MapAnim::yaw`). Each frame `minimap::ease_look(look, stick, enabled, heading,
base, dt)` eases it (same `ease_yaw`, rate 6/s, shortest arc) toward `minimap::look_target(stick,
heading, base) = wrap(heading + θ - base)`, or 0 when released, and wraps the result to (-PI, PI] so it
can't wind up over laps. Both maps call this one function; only `heading`/`base` come from their own
state (Dashboard: `minimap_cached_yaw` / `minimap_base_yaw()`, HUD: `target_yaw(pkt,
map_use_movement_dir)` / its eased yaw). The HUD's "still animating" check compares against the same
`look_target`, wrapped.

**Fixed bug (north-up offset):** the first version added `θ` straight onto the base yaw
(`view yaw = base + θ`). In heading-up `base ≈ heading`, so that was car-relative; but in north-up
`base = 0`, so the stick turned the map relative to *north* (stick right = east at the top whatever the
car's heading): the result was off by the car's heading, which reads as a "weird offset". The geometry
(pivot, arrow, compass) was always consistent; the reference direction was wrong. Tests:
`minimap::tests::look_is_car_relative_in_north_up_and_heading_up` (view yaw, car at centre, the
stick's world direction at the top, arrow angle, compass, and north-up == heading-up views) and
`hud::minimap::tests::map_anim_look_is_car_relative_in_north_up`.

Why:
- *Car-relative in every mode*: the right stick is the game's camera stick, which looks relative to
  the car; matching it makes the stick mean the same thing in north-up and heading-up (the user
  reported the north-relative version as "weirdly offset").
- *Angle only, not scaled by deflection*: the deadzone already gates it, and scaling the angle by
  magnitude would make a half-pushed stick point at the wrong direction.
- *A separate eased offset* rather than folded into the target yaw: it eases even with "Smooth
  rotation" off, and leaves north-up / ease-to-north unchanged once released. Known trade-off: in
  north-up the held look view follows heading changes through the look easing (rate 6/s), so it lags
  a little while turning, like heading-up with "Smooth rotation" on.

It is independent of right-stick *button bindings*: a bound direction still fires its action and still
rotates the map. HUD plumbing: `HudSink::with_stick` stamps `HudSnapshot::look_stick` at publish time
(the listener thread has no gamepad), so it updates per packet.

## Shared drawing (`hud/map_shared.rs`)

The Dashboard map and the HUD Minimap draw their markers with the same functions: `draw_own_arrow`,
`draw_remotes` (teammate arrows, edge pointers, names, paused grey), `draw_trail` (+ `TrailFade`),
`draw_waypoint`, and `draw_compass` (in `hud/minimap.rs`). Each takes a `MapCanvas` (painter,
`MapView`, centre, bounds rect, size factor `s`, fade alpha `a`): the Dashboard passes `s = 1`,
`a = 1`, the HUD its design scale and show/hide fade. Trail recording (`Trail`, `trail_push`) is
shared in `src/minimap.rs`. *Why:* the user wants the HUD map to match the Dashboard's, and one
implementation means a tweak to an arrow, label or trail lands on both. The buffers differ: the
Dashboard's is `ForzaApp::minimap_trails` (UI thread), the HUD's is `CoopLayer` (overlay thread).

## Co-Op integration

When in a [[coop]] session, the map additionally draws:

- **Breadcrumb trails** — each player's (including your own) recent path, drawn
  in their identity colour, fading out by whichever comes first: age
  (**Fade after (time)**) or distance behind the player's current position
  (**Fade after (distance)**).
- **Remote players** — coloured heading arrows with name labels when on-screen;
  off-screen teammates are clamped to the map edge as a small marker with the
  distance to them. A paused teammate is shown grey at their last known position
  with a pause glyph instead of their arrow.
- **Shared waypoints** — left-click the map to drop a pulsing diamond waypoint
  (in your colour) that every player in the session sees, with each player's
  distance to it shown; right-click clears it. Waypoints are only active outside
  Edit Mode (Edit Mode reserves clicks for drag/resize).
- **On-map player list** (**Show player list on map**) — a fixed-width panel in the
  top-right listing name, and optionally distance/speed/gear/car-class columns per
  player, so the layout doesn't reflow as values change.

Click/drag on the map is only sensed outside Dashboard Edit Mode, so grid
drag/resize gestures take priority while editing.
